# AffableBean-Spring
This is a new Spring-based version of the AffableBean online store-front, based on the Java EE / Netbeans tutorial. 
This version is developed by Jon Engelbert and Thien Nguyen  

Import it as a Maven project into Eclipse, then Run as Spring Application. 
At this point, it uses an in-memory H2 database, but it includes instructions for converting to a MySQL database.
